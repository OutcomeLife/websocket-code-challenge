Coding Challenge for Websockets
A websocket on port 8080 that responds to a message by reversing it!

The Challenge

Clone this repository to your local and get it running by using
`npm start`

You need to write a React SPA that allows the user to push a button to "connect".

Once connected they should be able to send a message through the websocket and the reply should be printed on their screen.

You should keep a running log of the sent and received messages.

There should be a disconnect button that sets them back to the original state of the app and clears all the messages!

Please commit your code to github and send us the link when you are ready.

Thanks!
